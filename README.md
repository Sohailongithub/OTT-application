# MERN Stack OTT Platform Development

## Introduction

This README outlines the development process for a cutting-edge Over-The-Top (OTT) streaming application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React/React Native, Node.js). The platform aims to deliver a wide range of digital content directly to viewers across various devices.

## Business Requirements Document (BRD) Overview

### Purpose

The BRD specifies the business objectives and functional needs for the OTT application, which includes streaming capabilities, user management, and personalized content delivery.

### Scope

The application will cater to a global audience with features optimized for web and mobile platforms, including smart TV compatibility.

### Stakeholders

This project involves collaboration among the project team, management, technical partners, content creators, and the end-user community.

## Project Setup

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neeraj-pratap-singh/ott-platform.git
cd ott-platform
npm install
```

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js for the web platform and React Native for mobile applications.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS for hosting and storage.

### System Architecture

The platform is built using a microservices architecture pattern with an API gateway to manage service interactions.

## Functional Requirements

- **User Registration and Profile Management**: Multiple profiles, customizable settings, and multi-language support.
- **Content Streaming, Searching, and Categorization**: Adaptive bitrate streaming, advanced search filters, and content sorting.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-based content suggestions tailored to user preferences.
- **Watchlist**: Cross-device bookmarking of preferred content.
- **Parental Controls and User Privacy Settings**: Age-based content restrictions and configurable privacy settings.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance Metrics**: Optimal load times and streaming quality.
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed to support a growing user base and content library.
- **Data Security and Compliance**: Adherence to data protection regulations.

## Development Guidelines

Developers should follow the established coding conventions and commit guidelines. Feature development is done on separate branches which are then merged into the main branch after thorough testing and code review.

## Running the Application

```bash
# Start the backend server
cd backend
npm start

# Start the frontend application
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Testing

Automated tests are written using Jest and React Testing Library for the frontend and Mocha for the backend. To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment. CI/CD is managed via Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployment to AWS.
